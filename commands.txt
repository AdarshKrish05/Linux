awk: The awk command searches and manipulates regular expression patterns in a file. we can run multiple actions by listing them according to their execution order, separated by a semicolon (;). 
sort: to rearrange a file content in a specific order
      A - Z (NA), Z - A (-r), numbers (-n)
Cut: Select specific sections from a file and print them as an output.
      -f – Select a specific row field.

      You can also ignore case sensitivity by adding -i.
locate: The locate command searches for a file and prints its location path.
find: it used to search for files and directories within a file system based on various criteria like name, type, size, and more
      -name: Search for files by name.

chmod: to change the permission of a file or a directories

There are three folder and file permissions: read (r), write (w), and execute (x). You can assign them to three parties: the owner, a group, or other accounts belonging to neither category.
Consider this example:             chmod -rwx---r-– file1.txt
The spot after the first hyphen (–) specifies the permission for the owner of file1.txt. In the previous example, we grant them the rwx privilege.
The next spot is for groups. Since we won’t grant them any privilege, we put three hyphens to indicate emptiness. The last slot is for other users who only have read or r permission.
